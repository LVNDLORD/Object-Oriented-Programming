# Test-Driven Development

[Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is a software development process that's based on constructing a piece of software in small iterations. In test-driven software development, the first thing a programmer always does is write an automatically-executable test, which tests a single piece of the computer program.
The test will not pass because the functionality that satisfies the test, i.e., the part of the computer program to be examined, is missing. Once the test has been written, functionality that meets the test requirements is added to the program. The tests are then run again. If all tests pass, a new test is added, or alternatively, if the tests fail, the already-written program is corrected. If necessary, the internal structure of the program will be corrected or refactored, so that the functionality of the program remains the same, but the structure becomes clearer.

Test-driven software development consists of five steps that are repeated until the functionality of the program is complete.

1. Write a test. The programmer decides which program functionality to test and writes a test for it.
2. Run the tests and check if the tests pass. When a new test is written, the tests are run. If the test passes, the test is most likely erroneous and should be corrected - the test should only test functionality that hasn't yet been implemented.
3. Write the functionality that meets the test's requirements. The programmer implements functionality that only meets the test requirements. Note: this doesn't do things that the test does not require - functionality is only added in small increments.
4. Perform the tests. If the tests fail, there is likely to be an error in the functionality written. Correct the functionality - or, if there is no error in the functionality, fix the latest test that was performed.
5. Repair the internal structure of the program. As the size of the program increases, its internal structure is adjusted as needed. Methods that are too long are broken down into multiple parts and classes representing concepts are isolated. The tests are not modified, but are instead used to verify the correctness of the changes made to the program's internal structure - if a change in the program structure changes the functionality of the program, the tests will produce a warning and the programmer can remedy the situation.

## Creating the program in small steps

1. Create a test that tests some feature that will be added to the program.
2. Run the test. It should not pass.
   - If the test passes, move to step 1.
3. Develop the program so that it has the functionality required to pass the test.
4. Run the tests.
   - If the tests donâ€™t pass, move to step 3 and further develop the functionality.
5. Refactor
   - If the program is ready, stop ...
   - Otherwise, go to step 1.

## An example

### Preparation: Create a skeleton for the class to be tested

In this phase we design methods and their parameters (API - Application Programmers Interface), but **not** the implementation. Code compiles, but does nothing.
```Java
public class Calculator {
    private int result;

    public void clear() {
        // not yet implemented
    }
    public void add(int n) {
        // not yet implemented
    }
    public void sub(int n) {
        // not yet implemented
    }
    public void mul(int n) {
        // not yet implemented
    }
    public void div(int n) {
        // not yet implemented
    }
    public int giveResult() {
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Device a test case and create a test method

Create a separate tester class for the class to be tested. Don't insert any testing code to the class to be tested. Then write to the tester class methods that invoke those methods to be tested (be careful with the parameters). For every method to be tested, create one or more tester method (e.g., one for each test case). According to TDD principles, first run tests so that the result is failure (to check that the test skeleton works).

The logic behind testing method:
- **arrange**: initialize test settings (e.g., create objects, etc.)
- **act**: invoke the method to be tested with test case parameters
- **assert**: check whether we got the expected result

```Java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.fail;

public class CalculatorTest {
@Test
void testClear() {
fail("Not yet implmented");
}
@Test
void testAdd() {
fail("Not yet implmented");
}
@Test
void testSub() {
fail("Not yet implmented");
}
@Test
void testMul() {
fail("Not yet implmented");
}
@Test
void testDiv() {
fail("Not yet implmented");
}
@Test
void testGetResult() {
fail("Not yet implmented");
}
}
```
