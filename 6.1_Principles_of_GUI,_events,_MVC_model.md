# 6.1. Principles of GUI, events, MVC model

In this submodule, you learn to write graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java. You also learn about event-driven programming and the MVC model.

Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses) or messages from other programs. The program responds to events by calling methods that handle the events.

The MVC model, on the other hand, is a design pattern that separates the data (model) from the user interface (view) and the logic (controller). The model contains the data and the methods that operate on the data. The view contains the user interface components. The controller contains the methods that handle events and update the model and the view.

The MVC model is the most important design pattern for a Java programmer. It brings clarity to the design of a program and makes it easier to maintain and extend the program. From now on, you should always use the MVC model when you write a Java program (except for very simple programs).

## 6.1.1. Installing JavaFX

The easiest way to install JavaFX into your program is to use Maven. Maven is a build automation tool that is used primarily for Java projects. It is used to manage the dependencies of a project, i.e., the libraries that the project depends on. When you use Maven,
you can often skip the tedious task of downloading and installing the libraries manually.

In IntelliJ Idea, you can build a new Maven project by selecting **File / New / Project...** and the selecting **New Project** on the left. Then, select Maven as the build tool.

In the new project, you will have a file called **pom.xml**. This file contains the dependencies of the project. The file follows XML format, which is a commonly used format for storing structured data. You may notice that the format resembles HTML a lot.

In the **pom.xml** file, the dependencies are added inside the ```<dependencies>``` tag that does not exist at this point. To add the dependencies, copy-paste the following code into the `pom.xml` file, right after the **properties** element:

```xml
   <dependencies>
        <dependency> <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId> <artifactId>javafx</artifactId> <version>11</version> <type>pom</type> </dependency>
        <dependency> <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId> <artifactId>javafx-graphics</artifactId> <version>11</version> </dependency>
        <dependency> <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId> <artifactId>javafx-fxml</artifactId> <version>11</version> </dependency>
        <dependency> <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId> <artifactId>javafx-controls</artifactId> <version>11</version> </dependency>
    </dependencies>

```

Once added, load the libraries by right-clicking on the **pom.xml** file and selecting **Maven / Reload Project**.

Now you are ready to write JavaFX programs.

## 6.1.2. Overview of a user interface

The key concepts of a JavaFX user interface are the following:
- Stage: The main window of the application.
- Scene: The contents of the stage. The scene contains the user interface components.
- Control: A component that the user can interact with. For example, a button is a control.


A stage contains one scene. It is possible to change the scene of a stage. A scene contains a component, or usually, an entire tree of components. If the scene contains more than one component, a container component is used. A container component is a component that contains other components. Each container component has a layout that determines the position of the components inside the container. We will use containers and layouts slightly later.

## 6.1.3. A sample GUI application

Let's start with a simple application that just prints "Hello World!" on the screen. The application consists of two classes: `HelloWorld` and `HelloWorldApplication`. For now, we place these classes inside the **src/main/java** folder.

The `HelloWorld` class contains the main method. It creates an instance of the `HelloWorldApplication` class and calls its `launch` method. The `launch` method starts the application.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HelloWorldApplication.launch(HelloWorldApplication.class);
    }
}
```

The `HelloWorldApplication` class builds the user interface:

    ```java
    import javafx.application.Application;
    import javafx.scene.Scene;
    import javafx.scene.control.Label;
    import javafx.stage.Stage;

    public class HelloWorldApplication extends Application {
        public void start(Stage window) {
            Label text = new Label("Hello World!");
            Scene view = new Scene(text);
            window.setTitle("My Greeting Application");
            window.setScene(view);
            window.show();
        }
    }
    ```


The `start` method is called by the JavaFX library after the application has started. The method is passed an object named `window` that represents the stage of the application. The method creates the user interface and sets it as the contents of the stage.

In the code, we create a label that contains the text "Hello World!". Then, we create a scene that contains just the label as its content. Finally, we set the scene of the stage and show the stage.

The **window** object that is passed as a parameter to the `start` method is the stage of the application. The stage is created automatically by the JavaFX library. 

The title of the window is set with the `setTitle` method defined in the **Stage** class.

The result of the program is the following:

![Hello World](./images/hello_world_window.png)

At this point, the first JAvaFX program is ready. In the next section, we learn how to create more complex user interfaces and make the application react to user actions.

## 6.1.4. Containers and layouts

Next, we create another application that contains more that one component. The application contains a label and a button. When the user clicks the button, the text in the label changes.

As we now need to put two components into the scene, a label and a button, we need a container component. The container component that we use is called `FlowPane`. The `FlowPane` is a container that places the components in a row. If the row becomes full, the components are placed in the next row.

Let's replace the previous `HelloWorldApplication` class with the following code:

```java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.layout.FlowPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class HelloWorldApplication extends Application {
    public void start(Stage window) {
        Label text = new Label("Hello World!");
        Button button = new Button("Click me!");
        FlowPane componentGroup = new FlowPane();
        componentGroup.getChildren().add(text);
        componentGroup.getChildren().add(button);
        Scene view = new Scene(componentGroup);
        window.setTitle("My Greeting Application");
        window.setScene(view);
        window.show();
    }
}
```

In the code, we create a button and a label. Then, we create a `FlowPane` container and add the button and the label into it. Finally, we create a scene that contains the `FlowPane` as its content.

The components are placed in the `FlowPane` in the order they are added. In this case, the label is added first, so it is placed on the left and the button is placed on the right. The `FlowPane` is not only a container but a layout. A layout is a container that not only contains other elements but also determines the position of the elements inside it.

The result of the program is the following:

![Hello World](./images/hello_world_with_button.png)

Try to adjust the width and the height of the window. You will notice that the `FlowPane` container automatically adjusts the size of the components so that they are stacked either horizontally or vertically depending on the size of the window.

> At this point you may notice that the content of the scene looks quite cramped: there are no margins between the components. We will fix this later.

## 6.1.5. Event-driven programming

Next, we make the application react to user actions. We want to change the text of the label when the user clicks the button. To do this, we need to add an event handler to the button. The event handler is a method that is called when the user clicks the button.

The event handler is added to the button with the `setOnAction` method. The method is passed the event handler as a parameter. The event handler is an object that implements the `EventHandler` interface. The `EventHandler` interface defines one method, `handle`, that is called when the event occurs.

Let's replace the `HelloWorldApplication` class with the following code:

```java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.event.ActionEvent;
import javafx.event.EventHandler;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.layout.FlowPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class HelloWorldApplication extends Application {
    public void start(Stage window) {
        Label text = new Label("Hello World!");
        Button button = new Button("Click me!");
        FlowPane componentGroup = new FlowPane();
        componentGroup.getChildren().add(text);
        componentGroup.getChildren().add(button);
        button.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
            public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
                text.setText("Hello Universe!");
            }
        });
        Scene view = new Scene(componentGroup);
        window.setTitle("My Greeting Application");
        window.setScene(view);
        window.show();
    }
}
```

In the example above, the event handler is written as an anonymous inner class. The event handler is passed as a parameter to the `setOnAction` method. The `setOnAction` method is defined in the `Button` class.

When the user clicks the button, the `handle` method is called. The `handle` method changes the text of the label to "Hello Universe!".

Now you can write a simple application that reacts to user inputs. In the next section, we will write a more complex application that uses the MVC model.
