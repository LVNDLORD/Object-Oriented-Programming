# Preparing the database and the connection

In this module, we learn to use a relational database programmatically. For this purpose, we start
by building a small database.

## 7.1.1. Installing MariaDB

If you have not yet done so, install MariaDB on your computer. You can find the installation instructions
from the MariaDB website: https://mariadb.org/download/. In the installation process, you need to set
the root password for the database. Remember the password, you will need it later.

To operate the database, you need a database management tool. You can use the MariaDB console or a database editor.
HeidiSQL is a popular database editor. You can download it from https://www.heidisql.com/download.php, or it may come
bundled with the Windows version of MariaDB.

Once the MariaDB database server has been installed, it will automatically run in the background.

You can connect to the database server using a database editor such as HeidiSQL. While connecting, use root as the username
and the password you set during the installation process. Set localhost as the host name and 3306 as the port number. That port number
is the default port number for MariaDB.

While carrying out administrator tasks such as creating a database, you need to use the root user. However, when you are
developing an application, you should not use the root user account but create a separate user for the application. We will address
this issue later in this module.

## 7.1.2. Creating the database

The commands for setting up a database are typically collected into a database script. You can compose the script using HeidiSQL or a text editor.
The database script is just a text file that contains SQL commands. The SQL commands are executed in the order they appear in the script.

We design the database script in such a way that it completely recreates the database.
That is, if you ever need to modify the structure of the database, you can simply run the script again and the database will be
recreated from the scratch.

To achieve this, we enter the following commands into the database script:

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS company;
CREATE DATABASE company;
USE company;
```

The `IF EXISTS` clause in the DROP DATABASE statement ensures that the database is dropped only if it exists. If the database does not exist,
the DROP DATABASE statement does not cause an error.

The USE statement selects the database that we want to use. In this case, we select the company database.


## 7.1.3. Creating the table

To begin with, we just add one table to the database. The table is called EMPLOYEE and it contains the following columns:
- id
- first_name
- last_name
- email
- salary

We also set the id as a primary key. For each table, it is important to set a primary key that uniquely identifies the rows in the table.
The primary key is used to identify the rows when we want to update or delete them. Also, the database management system automatically
creates an index for the primary key. Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of data from the database.

The following statement creates the `employee` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

The CREATE TABLE statement is inserted into the database script after the DROP DATABASE and CREATE DATABASE statements.

## 7.1.4. Inserting data into the table 

Sometimes, we want to insert some data into the table when we create the table. For example, we may want to insert some
initial data into the table. We can do this by adding the INSERT INTO statement to the database script.

The following statement inserts three employees into the EMPLOYEE table:

```sql
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (first_name, last_name, email, salary) VALUES
    ('John', 'Doe', 'johndoe@somemail.com', 1000.00),
    ('Mary', 'Smith', 'msmith@goodmail.com', 2000.00),
    ('Peter', 'Jones', 'peterjones@greatmail.com', 3000.00); 
```

The INSERT INTO statement is inserted into the database script after the CREATE TABLE statement.

Now you have created a database script, you can run it in HeidiSQL. To do this, select the script in HeidiSQL and click the
Execute button. The script will be executed and the database will be created.

## 7.1.4. Creating a user account and setting the privileges

So far, we have been working work the root user account. However, when you are developing an application, you should not use
the root account, as it is a major security risk. Instead, you should create a separate user account for the application.
Normally, it is enough to create just one user account with the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE privileges.

Technically, we can insert the user creation commands into the database script. However, it is better to create the user account
separately. This way, we can easily change the password of the user account without having to modify the database script.

The next statement creates a user account called appuser:

```sql
CREATE USER 'appuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

In the statement above, `appuser` is the username and `password` is the password. The `@'localhost'` part specifies that the user
account can be used only from the localhost. Normally, it is wise to restrict the user account to the localhost, as it is a major
security risk to allow the user account to be used from any computer. In reality, you may want to locate the database server software
on a separate computer and allow the user account to be used only from the backend computer.

The next statement grants the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE privileges to the `appuser` account:

```sql  
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON company.* TO 'appuser'@'localhost';
```

The statement above grants the privileges to all tables of the `company` database. If you want. for example,
to grant just SELECT privileges to the `employee` table for `appuser` connecting from a fixed IP address 139.112.64.8, you can use the following statement:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON company.employee TO 'appuser'@'139.112.64.8';
```

This time, we use the former version of the GRANT statement, as the connection is initiated from localhost. Also,
we may add additional tables to the company database later, so we want to grant the privileges to all tables at this point.

## 7.1.5. Testing the user account

To test the user account, we can connect to the database server using HeidiSQL. While connecting, use appuser as the username
and the password you set during the user creation process. Set localhost as the host name and 3306 as the port number. That port number
is the default port number for MariaDB.

If you have set the privileges correctly, you should be able to connect to the database server using the `appuser` account.

You can specify the database name in the database field at the login phase, or you can select the database after you have logged in.
T select the database after you have logged in, click the Database menu and select the company database. Alternatively, you can
issue the `USE company` statement.

Once connected, why not try a SELECT statement to see if the user account has the SELECT privilege?

Type the following statement into HeidiSQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM company.employee;
``` 

You should see the following output:

```
+----+-----------+----------+---------------------+--------+
| id | first_name| last_name| email               | salary |
+----+-----------+----------+---------------------+--------+
|  1 | John      | Doe      | johndoe@somemail.com | 1000.00|
|  2 | Mary      | Smith    | msmith@goodmail.com  | 2000.00|
|  3 | Peter     | Jones    | peterjones@greatmail.com| 3000.00|
+----+-----------+----------+---------------------+--------+
``` 

If you get an error message, you have probably not set the privileges correctly. Check the privileges again and try again.

## 7.1.6. Creating the database script

Now that you have created the database script, you can save it to a file. The file name should be something like `company.sql`.
You can save the file in the same directory where you have saved the Java source code files.

As the database script is now ready, and the database created, we can connect to the database from a Java application.

## 7.1.7. Creating the structure for a Java project

We will create a new Java project in IntelliJ Idea. In creating the project, we select Maven as the build system.
As a consequence, the project will be created with a pom.xml file. We will use the pom.xml file to install the JDBC driver.

The JDBC driver is not part of the Java SE standard library. It is a separate library that you need to install
in your project. The JDBC driver is available from the Maven Central Repository. You can install it in your
project by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml file.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Hint: Some JDBC drivers may use SLF4J for logging, and therefore require SLF4J-compatible logging libraries.
Without installing one, you may get warnings while running JDBC-enabled programs.
Thus, at this point, you might also want to add a dependency for a logging library:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.6</version>
</dependency>
```

Both `dependency` elements go inside the `dependencies` element. The `groupId` and `artifactId` elements
specify the name of the library. The `version` element specifies the version of the library.
Replace 3.1.2. with the current version of the JDBC driver, and 1.4.6. with the current version of the logging library.

After the pom.xml has been edited, you can select Maven/Reload Project from the menu. This will install the JDBC driver
and the logging library in your project.

If the installation is successful, you should see a tick mark on the Build tab of the Maven tool window.

Once the libraries have been installed, you can use JDBC in your project. In the next submodule, we will learn how to
connect to the database, and persist and retrieve object data using the JDBC driver.
