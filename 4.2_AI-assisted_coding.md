# 4.2. AI-assisted coding

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant developed through a collaboration between OpenAI and GitHub.
GitHub Copilot is designed to help programmers write code more efficiently and quickly. It integrates directly into programming environments such as IntelliJ Idea and automatically suggests code snippets or functions in real time as you type. Capable of understanding your intentions through the code you write, it learns from your coding style and past solutions.

In this submodule, we install GitHub Copilot and activate in in IntelliJ Idea. Then, we explore the functionality with a few coding assignments.

## 4.2.1. Installation and activation

GitHub CoPilot requires a paid or free plan. The use of GitHub Copilot is included in the GitHub Education package, which is available to all Metropolia's students.

To sign up for GitHub Education, proceed as follows:

1. Go to https://education.github.com/pack and verify your student status. As a consequence of the verification procedure, you should receive an approval notification by email.
2. Log in to GitHub. Click your profile thumbnail in the upper right corner and select **Settings**.
3. Choose **Billing and Plans / Plans and usage**.
4. Enable GitHub Copilot. In the **Add-ons** section, turn GitHub Copilot on.

Next, open IntelliJ Idea.
1. Choose **File / Settings**.
2. Click **Plugins**.
3. Type **GitHub Copilot** in the search box and click Install. After the installation, restart your IDE if the system so prompts.
4. Go to **Tools / GitHub Copilot**, and select **Log into GitHub**. Enter your GitHub credentials when requested and log in.
5. Click **Tools  / GitHub Copilot** and select **Show completions**. If this option is already turned on, you can skip this step.
6. Click **Tools  / GitHub Copilot** and select **Show suggestions**. If this option is already turned on, you can skip this step.

Now you should be ready to use GitHub Copilot. Play with it a bit to get a feeling of how it works. Then complete the following assignments to further explore the functionality.

## Assignments

Submit the answer of this assignment as a pdf file. The file should contain the source codes of the relevant classes as well as an explanation of how you used GitHub Copilot to write the code. For each of the three assignments, evaluate the applicability of GitHub Copilot for your own coding style. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using GitHub Copilot?

### Assignment 1: Using GitHub Copilot to write methods

In a new project, write a `Calculator` class that has the ability to sum positive integers. A negative integer should throw an exception.

The class acts as the model in the MVC pattern. It should have the following methods:
- A method that resets the calculator to zero.
- A method that adds an integer to the calculator.
- A method that returns the current value of the calculator.

In addition, write a temporary main method that creates an instance of the `Calculator` class and uses it to calculate the sum of a few integers.

Explore various way in which you can use GitHub Copilot to write the sum method. For example, try the following:

- Write the method signature and let GitHub Copilot write the method body.
- Write the method signature and the first line of the method body, and let GitHub Copilot write the rest. Then, modify the code to use a different loop structure (while instead of for, or vice versa) in the body.
- Write a comment where you describe the method in English, letting GitHub Copilot write the method body based on the comment.

### Assignment 2: Using GitHub Copilot to write unit tests

In this assignment, we continue the previous project and write unit tests for the calculator.

Write a unit test for the sum method. The test should verify that the sum of a few integers is correct. Use the assertEquals method to verify the result.

Again, explore various way in which you can use GitHub Copilot to write the test. For example, try the following:

- Write the test method signature and let GitHub Copilot write the test body.
- Write the test method signature and the first line of the test body, and let GitHub Copilot write the rest. Then, modify the code to use a different assertion (assertEquals instead of assertTrue, or vice versa) in the body.
- Write a comment where you describe the test in English, letting GitHub Copilot write the test body based on the comment.

Also, write a unit test that verifies that the sum method throws an exception when it is called with a negative integer.
Finally, write a unit test that verifies that the reset method resets the calculator to zero.

### Assignment 3: Using GitHub Copilot to write GUI code

In the last assignment, we continue the previous project and write a JavaFX application that reads the integers from a text field and displays the sum of the integers in a label. The GUI should have the following components:

- A text field for entering the integers.
- A button for calculating the sum.
- A label for displaying the sum.
- A reset button for clearing the text field and the label.

The following image shows the GUI application. Note that margins, padding, and other layout details are not relevant for this assignment.

Try to write the code for the GUI application using GitHub Copilot. For example, try the following:

- Write the code for the GUI application from scratch, letting GitHub Copilot write the code for the components and the event handlers.
- Write the code for the GUI application from scratch, letting GitHub Copilot write the code for the components and the event handlers. Then, modify the code to use a different layout manager (`FlowLayout` instead of `BorderLayout`, or vice versa) for the components.
- Write a comment where you describe the GUI application in English in sufficient detail. Then, let GitHub Copilot write the code for the components and the event handlers based on the comment.
