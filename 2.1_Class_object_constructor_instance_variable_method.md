# 2.1. Classes and objects

In object-oriented programming, a class and an object are related concepts but have distinct meanings.

***Class:***
A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that
an object of that class can possess. It is a conceptual entity that represents a group of objects with
similar characteristics. It describes the common structure and behavior shared by all the objects of
the class. Check [Oracle Java tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html)
for more information.

In simpler terms, a class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects. It specifies what
attributes an object will have and what actions it can perform. It defines the properties and methods
that objects of the class will possess.

For example, consider a class called "Car." The Car class can have attributes like color, brand,
and model, and behaviors like starting the engine, accelerating, and braking. However, the class
itself does not represent a specific car; it merely describes what a car is and what it can do.

***Object:***
An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that exists in memory and can be created
using the blueprint provided by the class. An object represents a specific instance of the class,
with its own unique set of attribute values. Check
[Oracle Java tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html) for more information.

When an object is created, it has its own state (attribute values) and can perform actions (methods)
defined by its class. Objects can interact with each other by invoking methods or accessing attributes
of other objects.

Continuing with the previous example, if the Car class defines attributes like color, brand, and model,
an object of the Car class could be a specific car with its own color, brand, and model values,
such as a red Toyota Camry. The object represents a concrete car that can be manipulated and used in
the program.

In summary, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the common structure and behavior of
a group of objects. It describes what attributes and methods objects of that class will have.
On the other hand, an object is an instance of a class—a concrete entity that exists in memory,
with its own state and behavior. It represents a specific occurrence of the class and can interact
with other objects.

## 2.1.1 Example objects of class Car


| myCar                                                                                                          | yourCar                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| float speed; (30.0) <br>float gasolineLevel; (49.9)                                                            | float speed; (100.0)<br>float gasolineLevel; (11.5)                                                            |
| void accelerate();<br>void decelerate();<br>float getSpeed();<br>void fillTank();<br>float getGasolineLevel(); | void accelerate();<br>void decelerate();<br>float getSpeed();<br>void fillTank();<br>float getGasolineLevel(); |

Now both objects, `myCar` and `yourCar`, have instance variables `speed` and `gasolineLevel` -
but they have different values. Both objects have the same shared methods. This means that all objects share
the same code in memory, but they have unique memory areas for holding instance variables.

### Instance variables and methods

Methods say what an object does:
- `myCar` can accelerate, decelerate, tell its speed, get its tank filled, and tell its gasoline level
- methods also possibly change the state of the object - acceleration increases speed and decreases gasoline, filling the tank changes gasoline level (unless tank was already full)

Instance variables say what an object knows about:
- `myCar` knows its speed and gasoline level
- _State_ of `myCar` is described by the values of its instance variables

### Manipulating objects

To manipulate an object, we call methods of the object.
Assuming object myCar has somehow been created (we’ll be back on how) we could do something like this:
```Java
/* Calling method fillTank which takes no arguments and does not return anything */
myCar.fillTank();
		
for(int i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
    /* Calling method accelerate which takes no arguments and does not return anything */
	myCar.accelerate();
}

/* Calling method getSpeed which takes no arguments and returns the current speed */
while(myCar.getSpeed() > 0)
    /* Calling method decelerate which takes deceleration amount argument and does not return anything */
	myCar.decelerate(10);
```

### Creating an object

To create an object we need to have a blueprint for the object. Blueprint contains declaration of
the instance variables and declaration of the methods an object has.
The blueprint in Java is called a class. Once we have a class defined
(we’ll come back to how this is done in a moment…) we call its _constructor_:
```Java
/* Variable myCar is a reference to an object that belongs to class Car.
 * After this declaration, however, it is not yet referring to any real object. 
 */
Car myCar;
/* Car class constructor Car() is called.
 * The returned reference to a newly created object is assigned to variable myCar		
 */
myCar = new Car();
```

### Defining a class

Class is a static entity, this means that the state of the class does not change during the runtime of the
application. On the other hand, state of the object changes during the runtime of the application -
every time when instance variables are written.

```Java
/* Define a class Car (class names are capitalized by convention).
 * Car is public (as classes usually are, more on this later).
 */
public class Car {
    /* An object of class Car will have instance variables speed and gasolineLevel.
     * Both are private (they can not be accessed outside the class methods).
     * Keep instance variables private whenever possible.
     */
    private float speed;
    private float gasolineLevel;
    private String typeName;

    /* This is the method (constructor) called when a new instance of Car is created (with new).
     * Constructors may also have arguments.
     */
    public Car(String typeName) {
        speed = 0; gasolineLevel = 0;
        this.typeName = typeName;   // this refers to the object itself.
                                    // The reference is useful if you want to use parameter names that are
                                    // identical to instance variable names (and for more, later on)
    }

    /* Implementations of some of the methods.
     * Note that methods refer to and change instance variable values.
     */
    public void accelerate() {
        if (gasolineLevel > 0)
            speed += 10;
        else
            speed = 0;
    }
    void decelerate(int amount) {
        if (gasolineLevel > 0) {
            if (amount > 0)
                speed = Math.max(0, speed - amount);
        } else
            speed = 0;
    }
    float getSpeed() {
        return speed;
    }
    String getTypeName() {
        return typeName;
    }
    void fillTank() {
        gasolineLevel = 100;
    }
    float getGasolineLevel() {
        return gasolineLevel;
    }
}
```

### Putting it together

In Java an application consists of a set of classes. In one of the classes `main()` method is declared,
and [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) will call this method when
the application is started.

Let’s create a `DriveCar` class where we have the `main()` method where an instance of `Car` is
created and manipulated. In Java class definitions are written in separate files so our application
will consist of two classes (Car and DriveCar) in two files (Car.java and DriveCar.java).

```Java
public class DriveCar {

public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar;

        myCar = new Car("Toyota Corolla");
        myCar.fillTank();

        for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            myCar.accelerate();
            System.out.println(myCar.getTypeName() + ": speed is " + myCar.getSpeed() + " km/h");
        }

        while(myCar.getSpeed() > 0) {
            myCar.decelerate(15);
            System.out.println(myCar.getTypeName() + ": speed is " + myCar.getSpeed() + " km/h");
        }
    }
}
```

When you press the run button, IntelliJ IDEA compiles DriveCar.java and Car.java. Then it will run
the application by starting JVM and telling it in which class to look for the `main()` method
(in this case `DriveCar`). Then the output is:
```text
Toyota Corolla: speed is 10.0 km/h
Toyota Corolla: speed is 20.0 km/h
Toyota Corolla: speed is 30.0 km/h
Toyota Corolla: speed is 40.0 km/h
Toyota Corolla: speed is 50.0 km/h
Toyota Corolla: speed is 60.0 km/h
Toyota Corolla: speed is 45.0 km/h
Toyota Corolla: speed is 30.0 km/h
Toyota Corolla: speed is 15.0 km/h
Toyota Corolla: speed is 0.0 km/h

Process finished with exit code 0
```

### Benefits of objects

## How to design the objects and classes?

A broad subject with no one simple answer! Some practical points until we take a closer look at this:
- When you think about an object, concentrate on the methods of the object
- After finding a set of methods an object should have (ie. methods the users of the object need), it is easier to think about the needed instance variables.
- Keep your instance variables private - this encourages encapsulation (keeping internal information private)

## User story

A user story is a concise, informal description of a software feature or requirement from
the perspective of an end user or customer. It is typically used in agile software development
methodologies, such as [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module), as a means to
capture and communicate the desired functionality in a user-centered way.

A user story is written in a simple and understandable language, often following a specific template,
such as:

"As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

For example:
"As a registered user, I want to be able to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account."

The user story captures the who (the user or role), the what (the desired functionality or goal),
and the why (the reason or benefit). It focuses on the value and outcome rather than technical
details.

User stories serve as a communication tool between stakeholders, product owners, developers, and testers.
They help define the scope of work, prioritize features, and guide development efforts.
User stories are often organized and tracked on a product backlog or a similar prioritization system.
During development iterations, user stories are broken down into smaller tasks and implemented
incrementally, allowing for continuous delivery and feedback.

### An example

1. A person moves to a new apartment and purchases a TV set.
2. He wakes up in the morning, and if the TV is not on, he presses the on/off switch.
3. He watches TV for a while and then turns to the next channel. After doing this for a while he gets tired.
4. After getting tired, he switches TV off and falls asleep.
5. Next morning he wakes up again, and continues doing the same operation again and again.

Analyzing the user story, we find that the following methods are needed:
- `new Television()`
- `boolean isOn()` and `pressOnOff()`
- `int getChannel()` and `setChannel(int)`

```Java
public class TelevisionViewer {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Television myTV = new Television();
		myTV.setChannel(5);

		for(int day = 1; day <= 10; day++) {
			System.out.println("Woke up, day " + day);
			
			boolean tired = false;
			
			if(!myTV.isOn())
				myTV.pressOnOff();

			while(!tired) {
				System.out.println("Watching channel " + myTV.getChannel());
				myTV.setChannel(myTV.getChannel() + 1);
				if(myTV.getChannel() % 4 == 0)
					tired = true;
			}

			myTV.pressOnOff();
			
			System.out.println("Falling asleep");
		}
	}
}
```
