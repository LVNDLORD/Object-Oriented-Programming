# Association

## Object referencies

Variables whose type is a primitive type hold the real value of the variable.
Whereas, variables whose type is a class hold a reference to the value of the variable
(You can think of this being just like a C pointer, but JVM may implement references any way it likes,
for example by pointers to pointers)

```Java
myCar = new Car();
yourCar = new Car();
				
myCar = yourCar;
