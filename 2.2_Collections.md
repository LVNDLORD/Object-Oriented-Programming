# Collections

It would be nice to be able to handle a bunch of dogs together as a collection -
insert new dogs easily into the collection, remove dogs from the collection,
not need to decide on the maximum number of dogs etc.

Java API has a rich set of [collection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/intro/index.html) classes that allow for more dynamic behavior,
and provide additional functionality.

Collection framework has classes that behave like:
- **lists** - when _sequence_ matters. Collections that know about ***index position***. Lists know where something is in the list. You can have more than one element referencing the same object.
- **sets** - when _uniqueness_ matters. Collections that ***do not allow duplicates.***
- and **maps** (technically maps are not collections but we often use them in collection contexts) - when ***finding something by key matters***. Collections that use *key-value pairs.* Maps know the value associated with a given key. You can have two keys that reference the same value, but you cannot have duplicate keys. Although keys are typically String names (so that you can make name/value property lists, for example), a key can be any object.

## Arraylist

[ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) is an example of
a list or sequence (and also array), it is a collection. There is no need
to decide on collection size at creation time (as it is with arrays). ArrayList size can grow automatically
when new elements are added to the list.

ArrayList behaves like an array, i.e., elements are accessible by index:
- add(i, e) - adds e into position i
- set(i, e) - replaces element at position i with e
- get(i) - returns element at position i
- (and more)

Arraylist behaves also like a list:
- add(e) - adds to end of ArrayList
- isEmpty(), size(), contains(o), remove(o)
- (and more)

ArrayList class is declared like this:
```Java
public class ArrayList<E> extends AbstractList<E> implements List<E>, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable
```
< E> is a [type](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/types.html) parameter -
it is instantiated when an ArrayList instance is created. This whole system is called as
[generics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/why.html). Java Generics is a feature
to enhance the type safety and reusability of code. Generics allow developers to write classes,
interfaces, and methods that can work with different types while providing compile-time type checking.

With generics, you can create classes and methods that are parameterized with type variables.
These type variables represent unknown types and can be replaced with actual types when the code is
used or instantiated. This enables you to create reusable components that can handle different
data types without sacrificing type safety.

The primary benefits of using Java Generics are:

1. Type safety: Generics ensure that the code is type-safe at compile time. The compiler can detect and prevent type-related errors, such as incompatible type assignments or method invocations.
2. Code reuse: By using generics, you can create generic classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with multiple types. This promotes code reuse and reduces code duplication.
3. Stronger compile-time checks: With generics, you can specify constraints and bounds on type parameters. This allows the compiler to perform stronger type checks and enforce restrictions on the usage of generic types.

To define a generic class or interface, you use angle brackets (<>) and a type parameter. For example:
```Java
ArrayList<Person> persons = new ArrayList<>();
```
Now we have variable persons which refers to an ArrayList whose elements are of class Person. Note that the Java compiler
can deduct the type of the ArrayList from the lest side of the assignment operator, therefore the type on the
right side of the assignment can be left empty, i.e., <>.

It is (of course) possible to iterate through an ArrayList by using indexing:
```Java
for(int i = 0; i < persons.size(); i++)
    System.out.print(persons.get(i));
```
But we also have a much handier enhanced for -loop:
```Java
for (Person person : persons)
    System.out.println(person);
```
This enhanced version works with arrays, too. Inside this enhanced for-loop it is not allowed to
modify the container content (adding or removing elements).

Let's have an example where we don't know at the compilation time how large array we need to store information.
In this case, we don't know how many names the user will enter to the system. Therefore we need to use
ArrayList collection class where the container can enlarge itself automatically when needed.
```Java
public class PersonTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String firstname, lastname;
        ArrayList<Person> persons = new ArrayList<>();
        do {
            System.out.print("Give firstname: ");
            firstname = scanner.nextLine();
            if (firstname.length() > 0) {
                System.out.print("Give lastname: ");
                lastname = scanner.nextLine();
                persons.add(new Person(firstname, lastname));
            }
        } while (firstname.length() > 0);
        System.out.println("Added " + persons.size() + " persons.");
        persons.add(0, new Person("Vilhelm", "The First"));
        System.out.print("Give the index of the person searched for 0.." + (persons.size()-1) +": ");
        System.out.println(persons.get(scanner.nextInt()));
        System.out.println("All persons:");
        for (Person person : persons)
            System.out.println(person); // calls Person.toString()
    }
}
```

## HashMap

Java HashMap is a class that implements the Map interface and provides an efficient way to store and
retrieve key-value pairs. In these pairs, each element is associated with a unique key that is used to
retrieve the corresponding value. The HashMap uses the hash code (an integer in Java) of the key to determine the bucket
(index) where the key-value pair will be stored. Hash code function for the Java String is calculated by evaluating
the following equation _hasCode = s[0]*31<sup>(n-1)</sup> + s[1]*31<sup>(n-2)</sup> + ... + s[n-1]_
where _s[0]_ is the first element of string _s_, _s[1]_ is the second element and so on. _n_ is the
length of the string.
```Java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "Java";
        String str2 = "Java Programming";
        String str3 = "";
    
        System.out.println(str1.hashCode()); // 2301506
        System.out.println(str2.hashCode()); // 1377009627
    
        // hash code of empty string is 0
        System.out.println(str3.hashCode()); // 0
    }
}
```

An element is retrieved using a key from the HashMap. Because HashMap is implemented using generics
```Java
public class HashMap<K,V> extends AbstractMap<K,V> implements Map<K,V>, Cloneable, Serializable
```
the key can be a general type. The only requirement is that it should have the hashCode() function.

Notice the difference between Array(List) and HashMap. Arrays use an integer index to retrieve elements,
HashMap uses an object (e.g., String, Person, etc.) to retrieve elements from the container. This kind of
retrieving is called as an associative search.

HashMap is often used thru Map interface, it has the following functions:
- put(k, e) - adds e with a key k to the HashMap
- get(k) - retrieves an element with a key value k, returns null if not found
- containsKey(k) - returns true when an element with key value k is found, false otherwise
- remove(k) - removes an element with a key value k
- size() - returns the number of elements in the HashMap
- (and more)

Iterating over all elements in the HashMap is possible using the enhanced for-loop
```Java
    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : scores.entrySet()) {
        // statements for handling one key/value pair (an entry)
    }
```    
 
Map interface method entrySet() returns a set, which has Map.Entry interface entries (key/value pairs).
These key and value values can be obtained using getKey() and getValue() methods of the entry.   

```Java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a HashMap
        Map<String, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>();

        // Add key-value pairs
        scores.put("Alice", 90);
        scores.put("Bob", 85);
        scores.put("Charlie", 95);

        // Retrieve values
        int aliceScore = scores.get("Alice");
        System.out.println("Alice's score: " + aliceScore);

        // Check if a key exists
        boolean hasCharlie = scores.containsKey("Charlie");
        System.out.println("Does Charlie exist? " + hasCharlie);

        // Iterate over the key-value pairs
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : scores.entrySet()) {
            String name = entry.getKey();
            int score = entry.getValue();
            System.out.println(name + "'s score: " + score);
        }

        // Remove a key-value pair
        scores.remove("Bob");
    }
}
```
