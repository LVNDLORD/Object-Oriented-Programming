Should we check that using a computer? - Yes, every time it is possible!

## An alternative for testing, mathematical proof

Instead of testing, another possibility is to mathematically [_proof_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_(computer_science)) that the algorithm/program is correct. It works in ever-increasing cases, but in general it is difficult. For example, in the following piece of code (in C programming language), is the variable `x` being used uninitialized or not?
```Java
int x ;

int k = 1, j = 1;
for (int i = 1; --j != 0 || k != 0; k = j != 0 ? i % j != 0 ? k : k-j : (j=i+=2));
System.out.println(x);
```
The answer is: nobody knows!

The for loop terminates if and only if `i` holds an odd [perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number) number, an integer that is the sum of its proper positive divisors (28 is a perfect number because 28=1+2+4+7+14).

In that nobody knows today whether odd perfect numbers exists, it is unknown whether the `println(x)` statement will ever be executed. Neither humans nor machines have a straightforward way of deciding this.

In practice, `println(x)` may be treated as unreachable because it is known that an odd perfect number must be greater than 10<sup>300</sup>, which means that at least 10<sup>600</sup> iterations must be taken. (Zellers, A., “Why Programs Fail, A Guide to Systematic Debugging”, MK, 2009, p. 166).

## Large programs are complex, modularize them

[Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) is related to the number of ways its components can interact. Software is full of components and their interactions. We can model the interactions/connections between components/modules using full [mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking).

If $N$ is the number of code lines in the application, $n$ is the average number of codes lines in a software module, then the number of interactions (&asymp; complexity) can be given as:
$$C(N,n)=\frac{(\frac{N}{n})(\frac{N}{n}-1)}{2}=\frac{\frac{N^2}{n^2}-\frac{N}{n}}{2}$$
This can be drawn as:

Thus we can reduce the complexity of the application by ncreasing the size of modules using:
- Information hiding
- Abstraction
- Interfaces


## Practical testing

### Error Situations and Step-By-Step Problem Resolving
Errors end up in the programs that we write. Sometimes the errors are not serious and cause headache mostly to users of the program. Occasionally, however, mistakes can lead to very serious consequences. In any case, it's certain that a person learning to program makes many mistakes.

As programs grow in their complexity, finding errors becomes even more challenging. The debugger integrated into IntelliJ IDEA can help you find errors. The use of the debugger is introduced in this good [tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-your-first-java-application.html).

### Stack Trace
When an error occurs in a program, the program typically prints something called a stack trace, i.e., the list of method calls that resulted in the error. For example, a stack trace might look like this:
```text
  Exception in thread "main" ...
      at Program.main(Program.java:15)
```
The type of error is stated at the beginning of the list, and the following line tells us where the error occurred. The line "at Program.main(Program.java:15)" says that the error occurred at line number 15 in the Program.java file.
```text
  at Program.main(Program.java:15)
```

### Checklist for Troubleshooting
If your code doesn't work, and you don't know where the error is, these steps will help you get started.

1. Indent your code properly and find out if there are any missing parentheses.
2. Verify that the variables used are correctly named.
3. Test the program flow with different inputs and find out the sort of input that causes the program to not work as desired. If you received an error in the tests, the tests may also indicate the input used.
4. Add print commands to the program in which you print out the values of the variables used at various stages of the program's execution.
5. Verify that all variables you are using are initialized. If they aren't, a NullPointerException error will occur.
6. If your program causes an exception, you should definitely pay attention to the stack trace associated with the exception, which is the list of method calls that resulted in the situation that caused the exception.
7. Learn how to use the debugger. The earlier video will get you started.

### Passing Test Input to Scanner

Manually testing the program is often laborious. It's possible to automate the passing of input by, for example, passing the string to be read into a Scanner object. You'll find an example below of how to test a program automatically. The program first enters five strings, followed by the previously seen string. After that, we try to enter a new string. The string "six" should not appear in the word set.

The test input can be given as a string to the Scanner object in the constructor. Each line break in the test feed is marked on the string with a combination of a backslash and an n character "\n".

```Java
String input = "one\n" + "two\n"  +
                "three\n" + "four\n" +
                "five\n" + "one\n"  +
                "six\n";

Scanner reader = new Scanner(input);

ArrayList<String> read = new ArrayList<>();

while (true) {
    System.out.println("Enter an input: ");
    String line = reader.nextLine();
    if (read.contains(line)) {
        break;
    }

    read.add(line);
}

System.out.println("Thank you!");

if (read.contains("six")) {
    System.out.println("A value that should not have been added to the group was added to it.");
}
```

The program's output only shows the one provided by the program, and no user commands.
```text
Enter an input:
Enter an input:
Enter an input:
Enter an input:
Enter an input:
Enter an input:
Thank you!
```

Passing a string to the constructor of the Scanner class replaces input read from the keyboard. As such, the content of the string variable `input` 'simulates' user input. A line break in the input is marked with `\n`. Therefore, each part ending in an newline character in a given string input corresponds to one input given to the `nextLine()` command.

When testing your program again manually, change the parameter Scanner object constructor to `System.in`, i.e., to the system's input stream. Alternatively, you can also change the test input, since we're dealing with a string.

The working of the program should continue to be checked on-screen. The print output can be a little confusing at first, as the automated input is not visible on the screen at all. The ultimate aim is to also automate the checking of the correctness of the output so that the program can be tested and the test result analyzed with the "push of a button". We shall return to this in later sections.


## Unit testing

Unit testing is a software testing methodology where individual units or components of a software application are tested to ensure their correctness and proper functioning. The purpose of unit testing is to isolate and verify the behavior of each unit of code in isolation, ensuring that it works as intended and does not have any unintended side effects.

Unit tests are typically written by developers and focus on testing small, independent units of code, such as functions, methods, or classes, in isolation from the rest of the application. The idea is to test each unit of code independently to ensure that it produces the expected output given specific inputs, and that it handles various scenarios and edge cases correctly.

Unit testing offers several benefits, including:

1. Early detection of defects: By testing individual units of code, defects can be identified and fixed early in the development process, preventing them from propagating to other parts of the application.

2. Simplified debugging: When a unit test fails, it provides a clear indication of which specific unit of code is causing the problem, making it easier to locate and fix the issue.

3. Code maintainability: Unit tests act as documentation for the expected behavior of units of code. They serve as a safety net when making changes or refactoring code, ensuring that existing functionality remains intact.

4. Improved design and modularity: Unit testing encourages developers to write modular, loosely coupled code that can be tested independently, leading to more maintainable and extensible software.

In the context of Unity, unit testing can be performed using various testing frameworks such as NUnit, Unity Test Framework, or third-party frameworks like MSTest or xUnit.NET. These frameworks provide APIs and utilities to write and execute unit tests within the Unity environment.

Unity unit tests typically focus on testing individual scripts or components within the game or application, checking their behavior, interactions, and responses to different inputs or conditions. This helps ensure that game mechanics, logic, and functionality work correctly and that changes or updates to the codebase don't introduce regressions.

Unit testing in Unity often involves creating test cases that simulate specific scenarios, setting up the required objects or dependencies, invoking methods or functions, and asserting that the actual results match the expected results.

By incorporating unit testing into the development process, developers can gain confidence in the reliability and correctness of their code, leading to more robust and stable applications.

## JUnit 5

JUnit 5 is a popular testing framework for Java applications, including those developed with Unity. It is the next major version of JUnit, introducing several new features and improvements over its predecessor, JUnit 4.

JUnit 5 provides a comprehensive and flexible platform for writing and executing unit tests in Java. It offers a rich set of annotations, assertions, and APIs to support various testing scenarios and methodologies. Some key features of JUnit 5 include:

1. Modularity: JUnit 5 is designed with a modular architecture, allowing developers to use only the modules they need. The framework consists of three main modules: JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupiter, and JUnit Vintage. The JUnit Platform serves as the foundation for test execution, while JUnit Jupiter provides the programming model and annotations for writing tests. JUnit Vintage supports running tests written in JUnit 3 and 4.

2. Annotations: JUnit 5 introduces new annotations for test configuration and execution. Some commonly used annotations include `@Test` for marking test methods, `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` for setup and teardown actions before and after each test, `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` for setup and teardown actions before and after all tests, and many more.

3. Assertions: JUnit 5 provides a comprehensive set of assertion methods for verifying expected conditions in tests. These assertions are more expressive and flexible compared to previous versions of JUnit. They include methods like `assertEquals()`, `assertTrue()`, `assertThrows()`, `assertTimeout()`, and others, making it easy to check values, conditions, exceptions, and performance characteristics.

4. Parameterized Tests: JUnit 5 introduces the ability to write parameterized tests, where a single test method is executed multiple times with different sets of parameters. This is useful for testing the same functionality with different inputs or configurations, reducing code duplication and improving test coverage.

5. Extensions: JUnit 5 supports the use of extensions to enhance test capabilities and add additional behaviors. Extensions can be used to perform actions before and after tests, provide custom test instance lifecycle management, modify test behavior, or even create custom annotations. Extensions allow developers to extend and customize the testing framework according to their specific needs.

6. Dynamic Tests: JUnit 5 introduces dynamic tests, which are generated at runtime based on some logic or data. Dynamic tests allow for more flexible and programmatically generated test cases, enabling scenarios where the number or structure of tests is determined dynamically during test execution.

To use JUnit 5 with IntelliJ IDEA, you can add the necessary JUnit 5 libraries as dependencies to your project and write test classes and methods using the JUnit 5 annotations and assertions. You can then execute the tests using an IDE, build tools like IntelliJ IDEA projects, Gradle or Maven, or the JUnit console launcher.

JUnit 5 offers a modern and powerful testing framework for Java, providing developers with improved flexibility, readability, and maintainability when writing unit tests. JUnit 5 official [documentation](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) is a quite good introduction to the properties of JUnit 5.

### IntelliJ IDEA JUnit 5 Set-up 

By default, IntelliJ IDEA uses its own build tool, IntelliJ IDEA projects. In order to be able to use JUnit 5 framework for testing, you need to prepare IntelliJ IDEA for testing, follow the instructions at this [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/testing.html). In summary, you need to:
1. Add testing libraries (JUnit) to your project. After this, the editor is able to recognize JUnit annotations (e.g. `@test`).
2. Then you need to create Test Sources Root directory. Follow the instructions carefully.

Your project structure should look like this:

![](images/JUnitProjectStructure.png)

Now you are able to create JUnit tests. First create the following Main class to be tested:
```Java
public class Main {
    public static boolean isEven(int number) {
        return ((number % 2) == 0);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 3;

        System.out.println("Number " + n + " is even: " + isEven(n));
    }
}
```

Then create the JUnit test class. Follow the instructions presented [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/create-tests.html), press `Alt+Enter` when the cursor caret is over the `Main` class name. Insert the following code to the `MainTest` class you created:
```Java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class MainTest {
    @BeforeAll
    static void beforeAll() {
        System.out.println("**--- Executed once before all test methods in this class ---**");
    }

    @BeforeEach
    void beforeEach() {
        System.out.println("**--- Executed before each test method in this class ---**");
    }

    @Test
    void isEven() {
        System.out.println("**--- Test isEven executed ---**");
        assertEquals(false, Main.isEven(3));
        assertEquals(true, Main.isEven(2));
    }

    @Test
    void testMethod1() {
        System.out.println("**--- Test method1 executed ---**");
    }

    @DisplayName("Test method2 with condition")
    @Test
    void testMethod2() {
        System.out.println("**--- Test method2 executed ---**");
    }

    @Test
    @Disabled("implementation pending")
    void testMethod3() {
        System.out.println("**--- Test method3 executed ---**");
    }

    @AfterEach
    void afterEach() {
        System.out.println("**--- Executed after each test method in this class ---**");
    }

    @AfterAll
    static void afterAll() {
        System.out.println("**--- Executed once after all test methods in this class ---**");
    }
}
```
When you run the test according [these](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/performing-tests.html) instructions, you should get the output like this:
```text
**--- Executed once before all test methods in this class ---**
**--- Executed before each test method in this class ---**
**--- Test isEven executed ---**
**--- Executed after each test method in this class ---**
**--- Executed before each test method in this class ---**
**--- Test method1 executed ---**
**--- Executed after each test method in this class ---**
**--- Executed before each test method in this class ---**
**--- Test method2 executed ---**
**--- Executed after each test method in this class ---**

implementation pending
**--- Executed once after all test methods in this class ---**

Process finished with exit code 0
```
