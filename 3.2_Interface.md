# Interfaces

An [interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html) is a programming
construct that defines a contract or a set of rules that classes must adhere to. It serves as
a blueprint for implementing functionality in classes. Interfaces allow for the abstraction of behavior,
enabling the definition of common methods that multiple classes can implement.

Here are some key characteristics and features of Java interfaces:

1. **Declaration**: Interfaces are declared using the `interface` keyword. They can contain method declarations, constant fields, default methods, and static methods.

2. **Abstract methods**: Interfaces can declare abstract methods, which are method signatures without any implementation details. These methods define the behavior that implementing classes must provide.

3. **Multiple inheritance**: Java interfaces support multiple inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces. This enables a class to inherit behavior from multiple sources.

4. **Implementation**: Classes that implement an interface must provide the implementation details for all the methods declared in the interface. This is done using the `implements` keyword in the class declaration.

5. **Default methods**: Starting from Java 8, interfaces can also contain default methods. Default methods provide a default implementation for a method in the interface. Implementing classes can use the default implementation or override it if necessary.

6. **Static methods**: Java interfaces can have static methods as well. These methods are associated with the interface itself and can be invoked without an instance of a class implementing the interface.

7. **Constants**: Interfaces can declare constant fields, which are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`. These fields are typically used to define constants that are shared by classes implementing the interface.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of an interface in Java:

```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog is eating.");
    }

    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Dog is sleeping.");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Cat is eating.");
    }

    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Cat is sleeping.");
    }
}

public class InterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();   // Output: Dog is eating.
        dog.sleep(); // Output: Dog is sleeping.

        Animal cat = new Cat();
        cat.eat();   // Output: Cat is eating.
        cat.sleep(); // Output: Cat is sleeping.
    }
}
```

In this example, we define an `Animal` interface with two abstract methods: `eat()` and `sleep()`.
The `Dog` and `Cat` classes implement the `Animal` interface and provide their own implementations for
the methods. The `InterfaceExample` class demonstrates creating instances of `Dog` and `Cat` and
invoking the interface methods on those instances.

Interfaces in Java serve as a powerful mechanism for achieving abstraction, enabling polymorphism
and defining contracts that classes must fulfill. They facilitate code reuse, modularity, and provide
a way to enforce consistency across classes implementing the same interface.

## Interfaces in Java Collections

In Java collections, interfaces play a crucial role in providing a standardized way to manipulate and
organize data. The Java Collections Framework defines a set of interfaces that represent different
types of collections, such as lists, sets, queues, and maps. These interfaces define the behavior and
operations that can be performed on collections, allowing for a consistent and interchangeable
approach to working with data structures.

Here are some important interfaces in the Java Collections Framework:

1. **List**: The `List` interface represents an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate values. Implementations of `List` provide methods for adding, accessing, modifying, and removing elements by index.

2. **Set**: The `Set` interface represents a collection of unique elements with no specific order. Implementations of `Set` guarantee that duplicate elements are not allowed. Common implementations of `Set` include `HashSet` and `TreeSet`.

3. **Queue**: The `Queue` interface represents a collection that orders its elements in a specific way for processing. Elements are typically added to the end of the queue and removed from the front. Implementations of `Queue` provide methods for adding, removing, and examining elements. Common implementations include `LinkedList` and `PriorityQueue`.

4. **Map**: The `Map` interface represents a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique within the map, and it allows for efficient lookup and retrieval of values based on their associated keys. Implementations of `Map` include `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `LinkedHashMap`.

5. **Iterable**: The `Iterable` interface provides a common interface for classes that can be iterated over. It defines a single method, `iterator()`, which returns an iterator for traversing the elements of the collection.

These interfaces serve as the foundation for working with collections in Java. They establish a set
of operations and behaviors that implementations must adhere to, ensuring consistency and 
interoperability across different collection types. By programming to the interface, developers can
write generic and reusable code that can work with various implementations of these interfaces.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of interfaces in Java collections:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class CollectionInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
        names.add("Alice");
        names.add("Bob");
        names.add("Charlie");

        for (String name : names) {
            System.out.println(name);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an `ArrayList` implementation of the `List` interface. We add elements
to the list and iterate over them using a for-each loop, which is possible because `List` extends
the `Iterable` interface. The example demonstrates the flexibility of working with collections
through interfaces, allowing us to switch the implementation from `ArrayList` to any other `List`
implementation without modifying the code that processes the collection.

The Java Collections Framework provides a rich set of interfaces and implementations that cater to
different requirements and use cases. By utilizing these interfaces, you can write more generic and
maintainable code, allowing for easier interchangeability and extensibility of collections in your
Java programs.

### Iterator abstraction

Iterator gives you a sequence of elements from a data structure, without you having to worry about
whether the data structure is a set or a hash table or a list or an array — the Iterator looks the
same no matter what the data structure is.

For example, given a List<File> files, we can iterate using indices:
```java
for (int ii = 0; ii < files.size(); ii++) {
    File f = files.get(ii);
    // ...
```    
But this code depends on the size and get methods of List, which might be different in another data
structure. Using an iterator abstracts away the details:
```java
Iterator<File> iter = files.iterator();
while (iter.hasNext()) {
    File f = iter.next();
    // ...
```    
Now the loop will be identical for any type that provides an Iterator. There is, in fact, an interface
for such types: Iterable. Any Iterable can be used with Java’s enhanced for statement —
for (File f : files) — and under the hood, it uses an iterator.
