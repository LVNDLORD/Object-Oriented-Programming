## Parallelism

It is possible to calculate the equation $y(x) = sin(5x) + cos(9x) + exp(x/3)$ in parallel.
if you have more than one calculation unit available, calculating sin(), cos() and exp() in three parallel calculation units speeds up the calculation of the equation y(x)
It is not always possible to run things in parallel, e.g., the equation y(x) = sin(5cos(9exp(x/3))) cannot run in parallel because terms depend on each other
Amdahl’s law: In parallelization, if P is the proportion of a system or program that can be made parallel, and 1-P is the proportion that remains serial, then the maximum speedup that can be achieved using N number of processors is 1/((1-P)+(P/N))
An example: you have two processors (N=2) and all your program can be parallelized (P=1), then the speedup is 1/(0+½)=2
Another example: you have four processors (N=4), and half of your program can be parallelized (P=0.5), then the speedup is 1/(0.5+0.5/4)=1.6
