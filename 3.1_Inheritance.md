# Inheritance

In Java, inheritance is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that allows a class to
inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It enables code reuse and promotes the concept of
"is-a" relationship, where a subclass is a specialized version of a superclass.

Here are some key aspects and features of Java inheritance:

1. **Superclass and Subclass**: Inheritance involves two types of classes: superclass (also called base class or parent class) and subclass (also called derived class or child class). The subclass inherits the properties and behaviors of the superclass, extending and refining its functionality.

2. **Keyword: `extends`**: In Java, the `extends` keyword is used to establish an inheritance relationship between classes. The subclass declaration specifies the superclass it extends. A subclass can only extend a single superclass, although multiple levels of inheritance are possible.

3. **Inherited Members**: When a class inherits from a superclass, it automatically inherits the members (fields and methods) defined in the superclass, except for constructors. Inherited members can be accessed and used by the subclass as if they were defined within the subclass itself. However, private members are not directly accessible in the subclass.

4. **Overriding**: Subclasses have the ability to override methods inherited from the superclass. By providing a new implementation of a method in the subclass, you can modify or extend the behavior defined in the superclass. This allows for polymorphism, where different objects of related classes can respond differently to the same method invocation.

5. **Access Modifiers**: Inheritance is influenced by access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`, and default). Members with `public` and `protected` access modifiers are inherited and accessible by the subclass, while `private` members are not directly accessible. The default access modifier allows inheritance within the same package.

6. **Inheritance Hierarchy**: Inheritance can create a hierarchy of classes with multiple levels of inheritance. A subclass can become a superclass for another class, forming a chain of inheritance relationships.

Here's an example to illustrate Java inheritance:

```java
class Animal {
    protected String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " is barking.");
    }
}

public class InheritanceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");
        dog.eat();  // Output: Buddy is eating.
        dog.bark(); // Output: Buddy is barking.
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a superclass `Animal` with a field `name` and a method `eat()`. The `Dog`
class extends `Animal`, inheriting the `name` field and `eat()` method. Additionally, the `Dog` class
introduces a new method `bark()`. In the `main()` method, we create an instance of `Dog` and invoke 
both inherited and subclass-specific methods.

Output:
```
Buddy is eating.
Buddy is barking.
```

In this way, the `Dog` class inherits the characteristics of the `Animal` superclass and adds its own
specific behavior.

Inheritance is a powerful mechanism in Java that promotes code reuse and enables the creation of
class hierarchies. It helps in organizing and modeling relationships between classes, allowing for
more flexible and modular designs.
