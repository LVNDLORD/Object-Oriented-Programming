# 7.2 Database usage via JDBC driver

In this submodule, we learn to connect to a database using the JDBC driver. We also learn how to persist information
in the database and how to retrieve information from the database.

We use the Company database introduced in the previous submodule as an example. So far, the database contains
just one table, the EMPLOYEE table.


## 7.2.1. Installing the JDBC driver via Maven

The JDBC driver is not part of the Java SE standard library. It is a separate library that you need to install
in your project. The JDBC driver is available from the Maven Central Repository. You can install it in your
project by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml file.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Above, replace 2.7.2. with the current version of the JDBC driver.

Once the driver has been installed, you can use it in your project. In the next section, we will learn how to
connect to the database using the JDBC driver.

## 7.2.2. Database connection

In this section, we learn how to connect to the database using the JDBC driver. We also learn how to close
the connection to the database.

## 7.2.3. Persisting information in the database

Once the database connection has been established, we can persist information in the database.


## 7.2.4. Retrieving information from the database
